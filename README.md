# Gradle Dependency Graph

Simple class (Node) that holds project dependency graph of Gradle multi-project build.

This library is used by [Spring Boot Multi-Project Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/vkuzel/Gradle-Spring-Boot-Multi-Project-Plugin) to hold a project structure.
The plugin serializes Node object into to file that can be read and used by an Java application. Check out [Gradle multi-project configuration template](https://github.com/vkuzel/Gradle-Multi-Project-Development-Template) for more details.
